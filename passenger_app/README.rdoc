For the first app, you would need to create 2 set of APIs.
The first set would allow me to:
1) create a passenger record with my phone number
2) retrieve my system generated password based on my phone number.

The second set you would need to be able to:
1) create a booking as a passenger (the passenger needs to be authenticated with the correct system generated password)
2) retrieve the booking id of the newly created booking.
3) retrieve the details of the booking with the driver's name and phone number.
